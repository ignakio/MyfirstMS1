## 3.3 UX Strategy 


The aim of this project is to raise awareness of the stakeholders business with a fully responsive and visually appealing site. The site should be easy to use and build on existing mental models of mobile first design. The business will have a wide demographic so the key information should be easy to find and accessibility will be very important. 

The primary objectives of the site would be 

- Give users the chance to learn more about the business
- Show customers what is unique about Beelive Fit Co. through text and visuals. 
- Be able to communicate what services the business offers in changing covid 19 requirements.

Meeting the user’s needs and goals

- The site should be fully responsive and have the same effectiveness on mobile and desktop.
- Imagery and icons used with short bursts of text. This will inform the user but not overwhelm and can give them the chance to learn more if they so wish.
- A single page scrolling site that will guide the user to the relevant section without confusing them by moving away from the core home page. 
- Fixed header to aid with the user’s navigation on the site for ease of use. 
- Clear indicators of social media links, contact number and google map locations if the user wishes to find the stakeholder or find out more about the business.

Following current industry best practices the site will be a one page scrolling site on desktop, with the navigation bar collapsing into a hamburger menu with a pop up modal on mobile and tablet. 

## 3.4 Scope

Using Lean UX a minimum viable product (MVP) was developed in order to learn quickly about what will work on the site. Developing the site in this way will allow time for testing and give ample opportunity to fix any bugs or features that may not be working. Using a Lean UX methodology will enable us to see if we 

- Can clearly communicate what the business is about and what services we offer to the local community. 
- Provide a way for users to connect or contact the business.
- Give returning user’s the chance to learn more about what class is on this week.
- Help new user’s locate us so they can visit us in the store
- Provide an overall positive experience across all devices that a new user may use. 
- That the site is built using correct HTML semantics and follows industry standards for accessibility. 

## 3.5 Structure

The website will operate as a scrolling one page site on desktop, with the navigation changing to a hamburger menu on mobile. The website will be broken into four sections that will help first time, frequent and returning users get answers to their questions. The navigation will be sticky and be viewable at each section of the site.

- About Us section
    - This section will clearly outline what Beelive fit is, what classes does the personal trainer offer and why you might choose Beelive Fit Co. over other Personal Trainers.

- Feedback section
    - This will provide some imagery to the user that will give them a feedback from some customers already using the business.

- Location section
    - This will provide the user with all of the information to help locate and visit the coach. There will be a map link to google maps as well as the address and contact number.

- Contact Us section
    - This section will help the user send a quick question or query to the business without leaving the site. This will present a good opportunity for the user to feel the have a direct line of communication with the business.

### 3.5.1 Information Architecture for the site

## 3.7 Surface

### 3.7.1 Colour

As the website is for a local personal trainer service the colours and style should reflect that in the design. In order to get an idea of some colours I took a look at some photos from google about bees and honeycomb.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Colors: rgba(255, 162, 0, 1) Orange
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        #555555 Grey
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) Black

### 3.7.2 Typography

- For the headings on the site I have chosen [Raleway by Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway). I decided to use this font as a wide demographic would be using this site. Raleway is clear and fits well with the brand aesthetic. It also is likely that a user may not have trouble with this font as most devices will support google fonts.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="readme_files/readmefilesimgs/beelivefitfont.png" style="margin: 0;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
- For the body text on the site I used [Roboto by Christian Robertson](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). Roboto is described as a font that allows for a more natural reading rhythm, which is will help the user navigate the content. Roboto is seen very often on websites and this in term will aid the user by building on existing mental models.
